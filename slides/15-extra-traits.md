#### Step 15 - Traits!
Stuck? No worries: http://bit.ly/summer-oo

## PROBLEM

You realize that you'll eventually have a lot more ship classes,
and a lot of them will have `name`, `defense` and `weaponPower`
properties along with the getters/setters (just like `NormalShip`).

Solution?

## STEPS

1) Create a new trait with the 3 properties (and getters/setters)

2) Use that trait from NormalShip

**GOAL**
Everything should work! But NormalShip should be a lot smaller. 

* Did you make the properties in the trait protected or private? Why?
* Disadvantages to traits?
