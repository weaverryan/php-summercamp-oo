#### Step 5 - ShipLoader Service
Stuck? No worries: http://bit.ly/summer-oo

## PROBLEM

Why is creating a ShipLoader in the controller a problem?

## STEPS

A) Register new services for ShipLoader and RandomShipSelector

B) Use these in your controller

**GOAL**
Everything should still work!

**EXTRA CREDIT**

Set your `PDO` service as private. Why would you do this?
Why doesn't it make sense to make the Ship objects into services?
