Stuck? No worries: http://bit.ly/summer-oo

## PROBLEM

What's awkward about this Deathstar class?

## STEPS

A) Create a `ShipInterface` and put all the public methods
that are needed there

B) `AbstractShip` implements `ShipInterface`

C) Make Deathstar implement `ShipInterface` directly

D) Update ShipLoader and BattleManager so things still work!

**GOAL**
Everything should still work!
